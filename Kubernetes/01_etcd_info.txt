******ETCD:-

The ETCD datastore stores information regarding the

cluster such as the nodes, pods, configs, secrets, accounts, roles, bindings and others.

Every information you see when you run the kubectl get command is from the ETCD server. 

Every change you make to your cluster, such as adding additional nodes, deploying pods or replica sets are updated

in the ETCD server. Only once it is updated in the ETCD server, is the change considered to be complete.
