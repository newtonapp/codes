Deployment - Update - Rollout
-----------------------------

kubectl rollout status deployment/myapp-deployment

### show you the revisions and history of our deployment.

$ kubectl rollout status deployment/myapp-deployment

#### Upgrade option


-> There are two types of deployment strategies.

-> for example you have five replicas of your web application instance deployed.

One way to upgrade these to a newer version is to destroy all of these and then create newer version


->  first destroy the five running instances and then deploy five new instances of the new application

*************
kubernetes deployment object creates a new replica set under the hood

and starts deploying the containers there at the same time taking down the pods in the old replica set
